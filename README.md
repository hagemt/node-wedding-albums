# wedding-albums

Favorites-enabled (single) photo album system using `react`, `redis`, and not much else.

React application is in `src`, separate from `api` (server code) and `scripts`, etc.

To develop: `npm run server` in one terminal, `npm run client` in another.

The `images` are hueg (10+ GBs) so those are just hosted on the site.
